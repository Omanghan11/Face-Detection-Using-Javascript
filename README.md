# Face-Detection-Using-Javascript

This project implements real-time face detection and face recognition using JavaScript and the face-api.js library. It runs directly in the browser and uses the user's webcam to detect and identify faces live.
(You need a live server via Visual Studio code to run the project since it's browser based. It won't work locally like opening file directly into browser)

Features:-
Real-time face detection

Face recognition using deep learning models

Built with face-api.js (TensorFlow.js-based)

Clean UI with responsive design

No server-side dependencies — fully client-side

Project Structure:-
index.html – Landing page with navigation and options to start detection/recognition

index1.html – Face recognition interface using webcam

face-api.min.js – Pre-trained model library for detection & recognition

script.js – JavaScript to run the detection/recognition logic

package.json – Project dependencies
